# Zero Dependency Software Rasterizer

### In Progress
The following rasterizer was created solely as a learning experience with the following idea in mind: use no external libraries. Currently I make use of glm but I will replace it when my math library is fast enough. 

The rasterizer can load any .obj file and render it with ease. In the future I want to add: support for multiple platforms (such as Linux and MacOS), accelerate the rendering with GPU kernels and create a library for graphical elements.
